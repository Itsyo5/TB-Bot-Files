# TB-Bot-Files
I've put my bot code in this repository. Although you can't use it right away, you'll have to install some node modules to use this bot. The node modules are listed below, and also how to install them with NodeJS.

**Node Modules and how to install them:** (These commands can only be perfomed in the terminal, and you'll need NodeJS for the same):-

***Discord.js:*** *npm i discord.js*

***MathJS:*** *npm i mathjs*

***Discord.js-Pagination:*** *npm i discord.js-pagination*
